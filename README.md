### MusicFeels (working title)

Goal of this site will be to add descriptions between chords, for example in the key of C, moving from G to C makes you feel like you're resolved/returning home sensation etc.... 

Use `npm start` in order to start webpack

`npm install --only=production`   installs only depedencies [and not dev]. If you want all my things then just do `npm install`
